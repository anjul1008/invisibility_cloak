# Invisibility Cloak


Being a harry potter fan I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisibility cloak. Well it turns out that 
using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfil my childhood fantasy. 
This turns a `red` colour cloth into an invisibility cloak.

>- It's a fun application which you will enjoy using.
